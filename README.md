# Bananagrams

### Summary
I created a single player Banagrams game. The website to view it is [View the Bananagrams site](https://perrshan.github.io/Bananagrams/){:target="_blank"}.

### Next Steps
- Currently it is only played by one person, but I want to expand it to be able to play over a network with other players.
- Add Cypress tests.
